I got covid last week and I'm not fine yet. I got same painful symptoms as I got from covid in my first time on 2023.
Muscle pain, sore throat, fever, chills and can't get out of bed.

This is my third time getting covid, the symptoms are getting worse than second time, but all the covid support by government have been removed. All the things in last few years like scamming, vaccines and humans isolation.

Hope world will be better in 2025.
