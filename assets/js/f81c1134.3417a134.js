This vulnerability originates from the upstream React implementation ([CVE-2025-55182](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55182)).\\n\\n## Impact\\n\\nThe vulnerable RSC protocol allowed untrusted inputs to influence server-side execution behavior. Under specific conditions, an attacker could craft requests that trigger unintended server execution paths, resulting in remote code execution.\\n\\n**All users should upgrade to a patched version immediately.**\\n\\n## Affected Versions\\n\\nApplications using React Server Components with the App Router are affected when running:\\n\\n- Next.js 15.x\\n- Next.js 16.x\\n- Next.js 14.3.0-canary.77 and later canary releases\\n\\n**Not affected:**\\n\\n- Next.js 13.x\\n- Next.js 14.x stable\\n- Pages Router applications\\n- Edge Runtime\\n\\n## Fixed Versions\\n\\nThe vulnerability is fully resolved in:\\n\\n- **15.0.5** (for 15.0.x)\\n- **15.1.9** (for 15.1.x)\\n- **15.2.6** (for 15.2.x)\\n- **15.3.6** (for 15.3.x)\\n- **15.4.8** (for 15.4.x)\\n- **15.5.7** (for 15.5.x)\\n- **16.0.7** (for 16.0.x)\\n- **15.6.0-canary.58** (for 15.x canary releases)\\n- **16.1.0-canary.12** (for 16.x canary releases)\\n\\n## Solution: How to Fix the Vulnerability\\n\\n### Step 1: Check Your Current Version\\n\\nFirst, verify which version of Next.js you\'re currently using:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm list next\\n# or\\ncat package.json | grep next\\n```\\n\\n### Step 2: Choose Your Upgrade Path\\n\\n#### Option A: Automated Fix Tool (Recommended)\\n\\nThe easiest way to fix the vulnerability is using the official automated tool:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpx fix-react2shell-next\\n```\\n\\nThis interactive tool will:\\n\\n- Check your current Next.js version\\n- Determine the correct patched version for your release line\\n- Automatically update your `package.json` and `package-lock.json`\\n- Provide clear instructions for next steps\\n\\n#### Option B: Manual Upgrade\\n\\nIf you prefer to upgrade manually, install the appropriate patched version based on your current release:\\n\\n```bash\\n# For Next.js 15.0.x\\nnpm install next@15.0.5\\n\\n# For Next.js 15.1.x\\nnpm install next@15.1.9\\n\\n# For Next.js 15.2.x\\nnpm install next@15.2.6\\n\\n# For Next.js 15.3.x\\nnpm install next@15.3.6\\n\\n# For Next.js 15.4.x\\nnpm install next@15.4.8\\n\\n# For Next.js 15.5.x\\nnpm install next@15.5.7\\n\\n# For Next.js 16.0.x\\nnpm install next@16.0.7\\n```\\n\\n#### Option C: Upgrade to Latest Stable (Recommended for New Projects)\\n\\nIf you\'re starting fresh or can upgrade to the latest version:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install next@latest\\n```\\n\\nThis will install the latest patched version (16.0.7 or newer).\\n\\n### Step 3: Handle Canary Releases\\n\\nIf you\'re using canary releases:\\n\\n- **Next.js 14.3.0-canary.77 or later:** Downgrade to stable 14.x\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  npm install next@14\\n  ```\\n\\n- **Using canary for PPR (Partial Prerendering):** Update to a patched canary\\n  ```bash\\n  npm install next@15.6.0-canary.58   # for 15.x canary\\n  npm install next@16.1.0-canary.12   # for 16.x canary\\n  ```\\n\\n### Step 4: Update Dependencies\\n\\nAfter installing the patched version, update your lock file:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install\\n# or\\nnpm update\\n```\\n\\n### Step 5: Verify the Fix\\n\\nConfirm that the patched version is installed:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm list next\\n```\\n\\nYou should see one of the patched versions listed in the \\"Fixed Versions\\" section above.\\n\\n### Step 6: Test Your Application\\n\\nBefore deploying, thoroughly test your application:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm run build\\nnpm run start\\n```\\n\\nTest critical functionality, especially:\\n\\n- Server Components\\n- API routes\\n- Server Actions\\n- Data fetching\\n\\n### Step 7: Deploy the Patched Version\\n\\nDeploy your updated application to production immediately:\\n\\n```bash\\n# Example for Vercel\\nvercel --prod\\n\\n# Example for other platforms\\ngit add package.json package-lock.json\\ngit commit -m \\"security: upgrade Next.js to patch CVE-2025-66478\\"\\ngit push\\n```\\n\\n### Step 8: Rotate Secrets (Critical)\\n\\n**If your application was online and unpatched as of December 4th, 2025 at 1:00 PM PT**, you must rotate all secrets:\\n\\n1. **Environment Variables:**\\n\\n   - Database credentials\\n   - API keys\\n   - OAuth secrets\\n   - JWT secrets\\n   - Encryption keys\\n   - Any other sensitive credentials\\n\\n2. **How to Rotate:**\\n\\n   - Update values in your hosting platform (Vercel, AWS, etc.)\\n   - Update `.env` files (never commit these!)\\n   - Update CI/CD pipeline secrets\\n   - Update third-party service API keys\\n\\n3. **Priority Order:**\\n   - Start with most critical secrets (database, payment processors)\\n   - Then rotate API keys and OAuth credentials\\n   - Finally, rotate less critical keys\\n\\n### Step 9: Monitor for Issues\\n\\nAfter deployment:\\n\\n- Monitor application logs for errors\\n- Check error tracking (Sentry, etc.)\\n- Verify all features work correctly\\n- Monitor for any suspicious activity\\n\\n### Important Notes\\n\\n- **No Workaround Available:** There is no workaround for this vulnerability. Upgrading is the only solution.\\n- **Immediate Action Required:** This is a critical RCE vulnerability. Upgrade as soon as possible.\\n- **Backward Compatibility:** Patched versions maintain backward compatibility with your existing code.\\n- **Breaking Changes:** The security patches do not introduce breaking changes to the Next.js API.\\n\\n### Troubleshooting\\n\\nIf you encounter issues during upgrade:\\n\\n1. **Clear cache:**\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   rm -rf .next\\n   rm -rf node_modules\\n   npm install\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Check for conflicting dependencies:**\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   npm ls react react-dom\\n   ```\\n\\n3. **Review Next.js migration guide:**\\n   - [Next.js 15 Upgrade Guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/version-15)\\n   - [Next.js 16 Upgrade Guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/version-16)\\n\\n## Resources\\n\\n- [Next.js Security Advisory (CVE-2025-66478)](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-9qr9-h5gf-34mp)\\n- [React Security Advisory (CVE-2025-55182)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55182)\\n- [React Blog: Critical Security Vulnerability](https://react.dev/blog/2025/12/03/critical-security-vulnerability-in-react-server-components)\\n- [Fix Tool Repository](https://github.com/vercel-labs/fix-react2shell-next)\\n\\n## Discovery\\n\\nDiscovered and responsibly disclosed by [Lachlan Davidson](https://github.com/lachlan2k)."},{"id":"covid-in-2025","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/covid-in-2025","editUrl":"https://github.com/ShigureDD/shiguredd.github.io/tree/master/blog/2025-10-24-covid-in-2025.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-10-24-covid-in-2025.md","title":"Covid in 2025","description":"Covid-19 in 2025.","date":"2025-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"covid","permalink":"/blog/tags/covid"}],"readingTime":0.28,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Tom Lam","title":"Software Developer","url":"https://github.com/ShigureDD","image_url":"https://github.com/ShigureDD.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/ShigureDD.png","socials":{},"key":null,"page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Covid in 2025","slug":"covid-in-2025","authors":[{"name":"Tom Lam","title":"Software Developer","url":"https://github.com/ShigureDD","image_url":"https://github.com/ShigureDD.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/ShigureDD.png"}],"tags":["covid"],"date":"2025-10-24 GMT+8","description":"Covid-19 in 2025."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Critical Security Vulnerability in Next.js","permalink":"/blog/nextjs-rsc-cve"},"nextItem":{"title":"How to fix lag on HEVC/H.265 Files with PotPlayer","permalink":"/blog/potplayer-lag-on-hevc"}},"content":"I got covid last week and I\'m not fine yet.
