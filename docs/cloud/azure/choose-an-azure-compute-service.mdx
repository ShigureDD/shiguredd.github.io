# Choose an Azure Compute Service

Azure provides many ways to host your application code. The term _compute_ refers to the hosting model for the resources that your application runs on. This guide helps you choose a compute service for your application.

## Decision Tree

Use the following flowchart to select a candidate compute service:

### Migration vs. New Build

**Migration Path:**
- **Lift and shift:** Migrate without redesigning the application or making code changes (also known as _rehosting_)
  - → Azure App Service (if cloud-optimized)
  - → Azure VMware Solution (if VMware workload)
  - → Virtual Machines (if cannot be lifted and shifted)
- **Cloud optimized:** Refactor to take advantage of cloud-native features
  - → Azure App Service
  - → Azure Container Apps
  - → Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

**Build New Path:**
- **Need full control?** → Virtual Machines
- **High-performance computing (HPC)?** → Azure Batch
- **Event-driven workloads?** → Azure Functions
- **Managed web hosting?** → Azure App Service
- **Need orchestration?**
  - → Azure Container Instances (simple)
  - → Azure Service Fabric (distributed systems)
  - → Azure Red Hat OpenShift (OpenShift)
  - → Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) (Kubernetes)
  - → Azure Container Apps (serverless containers)

## Understanding Hosting Models

Cloud services fall into three categories:

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Provision VMs along with networking and storage components
- Deploy any software and applications on those VMs
- Closest to traditional on-premises environment
- Microsoft manages infrastructure, you manage VMs
- **Example:** Azure Virtual Machines

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Managed hosting environment
- Deploy applications without managing VMs or networking resources
- **Examples:** Azure App Service, Azure Container Apps

### Functions as a Service (FaaS)
- Deploy code to the service, which automatically runs it
- **Example:** Azure Functions (serverless compute)

**Trade-off:** IaaS provides the most control and flexibility but requires more management. FaaS automatically manages nearly all aspects. PaaS provides partial management with some user configuration.

## Evaluation Criteria

When evaluating a candidate service, consider:

1. **Cost** - Review pricing models and calculate total cost of ownership
2. **Regional availability** - Ensure service is available in your required regions
3. **Service limits** - Check quotas and constraints for your workload
4. **SLAs** - Understand service-level agreements and guarantees

## Multi-Workload Applications

If your application consists of multiple workloads, evaluate each workload separately. A complete solution can incorporate two or more compute services.
