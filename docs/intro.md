# Introduction

I was facing an issue of forgetting my knowledge I have worked for, so I decided to create a blog to share my knowledge and experiences in software development and technology.

## What will in this Site?

In this blog, I'll be sharing:

- My knowledge and experiences in software development and technology such as programming languages, frameworks, databases, etc.
- How to set up a modern development environment
- My experience with cloud technologies
- And much more!

I hope you find the content valuable and engaging.
